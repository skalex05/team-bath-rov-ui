# Team Bath Hydrobotics ROV UI

## Installation

### UI Installation

To install the UI onto your computer, install this repo to a location of your choice. Next run:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Next, download [OCR-Tesseract](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki) for eDNA Sampling.

Finally, run `main.py` from the command line or an IDE of your choosing. 

**NOTE:** _`team-bath-rov-ui/source` must be your current working directory_. Otherwise, the program may fail to find certain files.

Please now also follow through ROV Installation if you would like to test the ROV locally.

### ROV Installation

To install the interface onto the ROV for bidirectional communication with the UI, please follow the [ROV Installation Guide](source//ROV_INTERFACE_INSTALL.md).

## Code Standards

Python code should be written to adhere to the [PEP 8 Standard](..%2F..%2F..%2FAppData%2FLocal%2FTemp%2FPEP%208-%20The%20Style%20Guide%20for%20Python%20Code.url) for laying out code to help maintain clear code readability.

Make comments where neccessary to help produce self documenting code!

Type hints should be used where appropriate. This can greatly help with development and debugging; Tools like IntelliJ can use these for providing more accurate code suggestions.

Ensure any **blocking** operations do not occur on **QT's UI threads** to prevent freezing. Use **threading.Thread** and **QThread** where appropriate.

**Do not** overuse comments/use comments to explain trivial tasks.


Use [QT Creator](https://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/creator-how-to-install.html) for designing the layout of the UI, stored in `*.ui` files.

Any code editor should work fine during development; ideally one which aligns with PEP 8.


## Design Overview

Refer frequently to design resources to ensure implementations are fit for purpose. 

User experience and simplicity are crucial aspects of the design.

The system will be used in a time sensitive environment and thus it is important that it is responsive and requires minimal input from the user.

Additionally, the competition strains safety and risk mitigation with the design of our system. This should be reflected within the UI as well as the ROV itself.

Ensuring that the UI is designed to be fault tolerant and gracefully handle unexpected scenarios is essential.

This README will serve as a document for defining specific code implementations in QT.

## Development Process

Create your own branch of this repo which you can use to push changes to.
Install all dependencies to the project by running the following in the project directory:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Code can either be run in your code editor or from QT Creator by running `main.py`.

The project directory for your chosen editor should be within the `/source` folder.

**Note**: QT Creator may require you to specify a run configuration in which case yours should look like the following:

The script attribute should refer to `main.py`

# Implementation

## App Object

The app object inherits from `QApplication` and is used to contain everything related to the UI.

Information pertaining to the current state of the UI should be stored here so that it is globally visible to different widgets in the application.

Other widget objects should contain an attribute referencing to this app object so that they can retrieve shared program information.

**The app stores information including:**

- Tasks
- References to each `Window` Widget
- Reference to the `Dock` Widget
- Information about processes that send "dummy" data to the UI (Temporary)

**Signals:**

- `task_checked` - Raised when a checkbox in the list of tasks is changed.

**Methods:**

- `close()` - Closes all windows associated with the application, joins all external threads, closes all associated processes.
- `reset_task_completion()` - Sets all the tasks to incomplete.

## Task Object

This object inherits `QWidget` and is used to store information about a particular task. This includes a title, description and time when the user should start this task. The `Task` loads a template widget from `task_widget.ui` which contains a checkbox and label for the `start_time`.

**Methods:**

- `set_attr_(key, value)` - Overwritten to update widgets if the `Task`'s attributes are changed.
- `on_check()` - Called when the checkbox is checked/unchecked. This changes the complete attribute and emits `App`'s `Task_Checked` signal.

## DataInterface Object

The `DataInterface` consists of `SockStreamSend` and `QSockStreamRecv Objects` which are used for the processing of ROV/Float data, video feeds, stdout and controller input.


**Attributes:**

There are attributes for the ROV and Float. These attribute names should match exactly to those specified by the `ROVData` and `FloatData` classes.

- `app` - `App`
- `windows` - List[`Window`]
- `camera_feed_count` - int (3)
- `redirect_stdout` - io.StringIO
- `redirect_stderr` - io.StringIO
- `joystick` - pygame.Joystick
- `camera_feeds` - List[`VideoFrame`]
- `camera_threads` - List[`QSockStreamRecv`]
- `rov_data_thread` - `QSockStreamRecv`
- `float_data_thread` - `QSockStreamRecv`
- `stdout_data_thread` - `QSockStreamRecv`
- `controller_input_thread` - `SockStreamSend`

**Threads:**

Some threads will be of type `QSockStreamRecv` or `SockStreamSend` if they are **constantly** receiving/sending data. 

These threads will **emit signals** upon **connection**, **disconnection** and when **new data is received**.

These threads will be either UDP (message may not reach destination, lower latency) or TCP (guaranteed message delivery but higher latency)

- `Video Stream Thread`(s - One for each video stream) -  **Port** **52524/52523/52522** - **UDP** - `QSockStreamRecv`

- `ROV Data Thread` **Port 52525** - `QSockStreamRecv`

- `ROV Controller Input Thread` **Port 52526** - `SockStreamSend` - TCP

- `Stdout UI Thread`  - `Thread`

- `Stdout Socket Thread` - **52535** - `QSockStreamRecv` - TCP

- `Float Data Thread` - **Port 52625** - `QSockStreamRecv` - TCP

**Signals:**

These sockets can be connceted to by windows if they are supposed to display information from `DataInterface`

- `rov_data_update()`
- `float_data_update()`
- `stdout_update(StdoutType, str)`

**Methods:**

Each Thread has it's own function that it runs which are contained inside this class:

- `is_rov_connected()` - Check if the ROV is connected to the UI.

- `is_float_connected()` - Check if Float is connected to the UI.

- `is_controller_connected()` - Check if a controller is connected to the UI.

- `on_camera_feed_disconnect()` - **Emits** the **new_frame** of the associated `VideoFrame`

- `on_rov_data_sock_recv(payload_bytes)` - Takes in bytes from the `ROV Data Thread` and updates ROV attributes in the `DataInterface`. Emits the `rov_data_update()` signal.

- `on_float_data_sock_recv(payload_bytes)` - Takes in bytes from the `Float Data Thread` and Updates Float attributes in the `DataInterface`. Emits the `float_data_update()` signal.

- `on_video_stream_sock_recv(payload_bytes, i)`  Takes in bytes from a `Video Stream Thread` for the *i*th camera and updates `self.camera_feeds[i]` with the newest frame. Emits `new_frame` of the associated `VideoFrame`.

- `f_stdout_ui_thread()` - Captures internal UI stdout. Emits the `stdout_update(StdoutType, str)` signal.

- `on_stdout_sock_recv(payload_bytes)` - Listens for stdout sent across a socket. Emits the `stdout_update(StdoutType, str)`

- `get_controller_input()` - Called by the `ROV Controller Input Thread` and returns controller input. 

- `close()` - Join all threads to gracefully close the `DataInterface`

## StdoutTypes

This is an enum class to help represent the types of `stdout` that should be displayed in the window. This includes the following:

- `UI` - General stdout from UI processes will have this type.
- `UI ERR` - Internal errors within the UI will have this type.
- `ROV` - General stdout sent across the stdout socket for the ROV.
- `ROV ERR` - Any errors reported from the ROV via the stdout socket.

## ROVData

This is a **pickleable** object containing metrics from the ROV which are sent across a socket to be recieved by the UI process.

Attribute names in `ROVData` **must match exactly** to a corresponding attibute in `DataInterface`.

**Attributes:**

- `attitude` - Vector3
- `angular_acceleration` - Vector3
- `angular_velocity` - Vector3
- `acceleration` - Vector3
- `velocity` - Vector3
- `depth` - float
- `ambient_temperature` - float
- `ambient_pressure` - float
- `internal_temperature ` - float
- `cardinal_direction` - float
- `grove_water_sensor` - float
- `actuator_1` - float
- `actuator_2` - float
- `actuator_3` - float
- `actuator_4` - float
- `actuator_5` - float
- `actuator_6` - float

## FloatData

This is a **pickleable** object containing metrics from the Float which are sent across a socket to be recieved by the UI process.

Attribute names in `FloatData` **must match exactly** to a corresponding attibute in `DataInterface`.

**Attributes:**

- `float_depth` - float

## VideoStream Object

This is used to store information related to the camera feeds **on the ROV**. Different processes are used when dealing with video **in the UI**.

**Methods:**

- `start_init_camera_feed()` - This creates a thread which runs `init_camera_feed()`
- `init_camera_feed()` - This function attempts to grab a frame from the `camera_feed`. If it is successful, it will start a thread to continuously grab new frames from the `cv2.VideoCapture` object. Otherwise, it will attempt several more times by recursively calling the function until a maximum number of attempts are reached.
- `get_camera_frame()` - Retrieves, encodes and pickles the most recently grabbed frame so it is ready to be sent to the UI.

## Socket Sending and Recieving

The following two classes provide robust protocols for sending and receiving various different messages via **TCP** and **UDP**.

### SockStreamRecv

**Init Parameters:**

- `app` - The `App` object if applicable so the thread will close gracefully. `App = None` is allowed but this is blocking.  
- `connected` - A boolean that indicates if a connection is sending data.
- `addr` - The **IP Address** that the connection will be bound to.
- `port` - The port the socket is bound to. 
- `on_recv` - A required function that is called when a new message is received.
- `on_connect` - A function that can be passed which is called a socket connection opens.
- `on_disconnect` - A function that can be passed which is called when a socket connection closes.
- `buffer_size` - Size of the socket buffer in bytes. **Maximum** Size for **UDP** is **65535** bytes.
- `timeout` - How long the socket will attempt to perform an operation before timing out.

**TCP Protocol:**

1. Listen for a new connection on the specified `port` and `addr` (this will timeout if one is not found and then will repeat **1.**)
2. A connection is established and `on_connect` is called.
3. A buffer (referred to as `incoming_bytes`) is created for holding bytes read from the socket buffer. A flag to indicate the start of a new message is created (referred to as `read_start`) and is set to **true**. A final buffer stores our recieved `payload`.
4. Bytes are sent across the socket and placed into our socket buffer.
5. Bytes are read from the socket buffer and appended to `incoming_bytes`
6. If `read_start` is **true** (We are at the start of a new message), extract the header from the start of `incoming_bytes` and continue to **7.** Otherwise we go to **9.**
7. Our `header` contains `Message Size In Bytes`, `Timestamp of Send`, `Send Frequency`.
8. The `header` is removed from `incoming_bytes`
9. `incoming_bytes` are appended to our `payload`.
10. If the size of our `payload` is larger than our expected `msg_size` we have recieved our whole message (and some of the next message). Otherwise we empty `incoming_bytes` and go back to **4.**
11. `payload` is truncated to our `msg_size`. `incoming_bytes` is emptied and subsequent bytes after `msg_size` in `payload` are placed into `incoming_bytes`
12. `read_start` is set back to **true** to read the next message. The thread's `on_recv` function is called. We go back to **4.**

If at any point a connection becomes unresponsive(times out) or causes a connection error, the thread will return to **1.**
If this occurs, `on_disconnect` is called.

**UDP Protocol:**

1. Bind to a socket on the specified `port` and `addr`.
2. Attempt to recieve bytes from the buffer.
3. If the time since bytes were last recieved exceeds `timeout` period, go back to **1.** and call `on_disconnect` if previosuly connected. Otherwise, if no bytes were recieved go back to **2.**
4. Bytes have been recieved and are moved from the socket buffer to `payload_bytes`. If not already connected, call `on_connect`
5. Extract the header from `payload bytes`
5. The header should consist of `Message Size In Bytes`, `Timestamp of Send`, `Send Frequency`.
6. Call the `on_recv` function.
7. If the time since `last_msg` is lower than that needed for `Send Frequency`, sleep until `Send Frequency` is matched in the reciever.
8. Go back to **2**.

### SockStreamSend

***NOTE: If `sleep` is set to a low value, the thread may be sending data faster than the recieving socket can cope with. This can lead to degredation in the responsiveness in connections. Consider switching to UDP or sending less frequently*** 

- `app` - The UI app object if applicable so the thread will close gracefully. App = None is allowed otherwise but this is blocking.  
- `connected` - A boolean that indicates if a connection is receiving data.
- `addr` - The **IP Address** that the connection will be bound to.
- `port` - The port the socket is bound to.
- `sleep` - The interval in seconds the thread should wait before sending the next message. 
- `get_data` - A function that can be passed which is used to provide data to send across the socket. This function should return bytes.
- `on_connect` - A function that can be passed which is called when a socket connection opens. 
- `on_disconnect` - A function that can be passed which will be called whenever a socket connection closes.
- `timeout` - How long the socket will attempt to perform an operation before timing out.

**TCP Protocol:**

1. Attempt to connect to the specified `port` and `addr` (this will timeout if one is not found and then will repeat **1.**)
2. A connection is established and `on_connect` is called.
3. The thread will sleep the amount of time specified by `sleep`.
4. Data is recieved from `get_data()`. If no data is provided, we return to **3.**
5. Create the payload. This begins with the **header**, consisting of `Message Size In Bytes`, `Timestamp of Send`, `Send Frequency`. Data from `get_data()` is appended to the end.
6. Send the payload across the socket.

If at any point a connection becomes unresponsive(times out) or causes a connection error, the thread will return to **1.**
If this occurs, `on_disconnect` is called.

**UDP Protocol:**

1. Create a non-blocking socket on the specified `addr` and `port`.
2. Data is recieved from `get_data()` and is appended behind a **header** consisting of `Message Size In Bytes`, `Timestamp of Send`, `Send Frequency`.
3. The data is attempted to be sent across the socket.
4. If successful, `on_connect` is called and the thread sleeps. Go to **2.**
5. If unsuccessful, `on_disconnect` is called if the thread had been connected. Go to **1.**


### SockSend

This is a function that can be used to send a one-off message to a thread. 

It will behave very similarly to SockStreamSend but for a single message. **This function is blocking**. Ideally run this function on its own thread.

For this function you can specify the following parameters:

- `app` - The UI app object if applicable so the thread will close gracefully. App = None is allowed otherwise but this is blocking.  
- `addr` - The **IP Address** that the connection will be bound to.
- `port` - The port the socket is bound to.
- `msg` - Message to send across the socket
- `max_retries` - Maximum number of times the function will try to send the message before failing. If max_retries is set to a value less than 1, the function will retry perpetually until the message is sent. (**NOTE: This could be dangerous if SockSend is called from a key thread and blocks.**)

## Window Widget

Each window is a frameless, full screen window that can be moved around to different monitors using the `NavBar` at the top of the screen. A window will automatically reposition itself to ensure the entire window is visible. 

The `Window` class is a subclass of `QFrame` and is a container for all UI content within a window. 
The `Window` class should not be used directly but only through the subclasses `Pilot`,`Copilot` and`Grapher`. 
Each window should load all static widgets through a `.ui` of the same name. 

Widgets inside a window can be referenced like so:

![](README-IMAGES/widgetreferencing.png)

Including type hints here makes development much easier.

The `__init__` method takes three arguments:

- file - The `*.ui` file to be loaded into the window.
- app - The `App` parent to this window. The window can reference this to get global data.
- monitor - A `Monitor` object from the `screeninfo` library. This is used to determine which monitor the window should appear on at launch.

**Methods:**

- `attach_nav_bar()` - Used on startup by the `App` object to build the window's `NavBar`
- `attach_data_interface()` - Should be overridden by subclasses if their window requires connecting to `DataInterface` signals.
- `close_event()` - Triggered by the window closing. If a window closes, so should the entire app.

## Dock Widget

The `Dock` widget inherits from `QStackedWidget` and allows multiple `Window` objects to be stacked ontop of each other if there are not enough displays available.
See the section on the `NavBar` widget as that is used in conjunction with the `Dock` to allow the user to switch between the different windows in the stack.

Whenever a widget is added(docked) or removed(undocked), `on_dock_change()` is called.

When `Window` at the top of the stack changes, the `WindowTitle` propertty of the `Dock` is changed.

**Methods:**

- `is_dockable()` - determines if windows can be docked. This will be true only if the user has multiple monitors connected.
- `add_windows(*windows)` - adds windows to the stack. Calls `on_dock_change()`
- `on_current_window_change()` - Updates the `Navbar` and `Window` title of the `Window` at the top of the `dock`.
- `on_dock_change()` - Rebuilds the `NavBar` for each `Window` in the stack.
- `close_event()` - Triggered when  the window is closing. If a window closes, so should the entire app.

## NavBar Widget

Each window has a custom navigation bar at the top of the screen to override the default one provided by Windows.

It provides functionality for **moving a window to a different screen**, **minimising** and **closing** windows and **docking/undocking** windows.
For docked windows, the navbar will list all other docked windows that the user can switch to and view.

**Methods:**

- `generate_layout()` - Creates `QPushButton`s for each standard button and `NavWindowButton`s for each docked window. These are displayed on the `NavBar`.
- `clear_layout(layout)` - Removes all of the `QPushButton`s from the `NavBar` layout.
- `minimise()` - minimises the `Dock` if the parent `Window` is *docked* and minimises the parent `Window` itself if it is *undocked*.
- `f_dock()` - adds the parent `Window` to the `Dock`
- `f_undock()` - removes the parent `Window` to the `Dock` and creates the `Window` in a standalone frame.
- `mousePressEvent(event)` - an event to set the start position of the cursor when dragging the `NavBar`.
- `mouseReleaseEvent(event)` - on release, the window should be maximised to fit the monitor it predominantly occupies.
- `mouseMoveEvent(event)` - reposition the window while the user is holding and dragging the cursor.

# Window Subclass Overview

In the below sections are more details about the implementation of each of the three windows in the application.

The bulk of most of these subclasses contain mostly trivial, repetitive defining of attributes for accessing widgets using `self.findChild()` (See example in the `Window` section above for more info).

These should override `attach_data_interface` if a window requires connecting to a `DataInterface` signal.

# Pilot Window

**This window should display:**

- All `VideoStream`s.
- Current `Task` information.
- Temperature and pressure data.
- Critical Alerts
- A 3D model of the ROV
- Timer

**Methods:**

- `on_task_change()` - The current and next tasks are retrieved and all associated widgets are updated. Current and next tasks are not necessarily contiguous.
- `attach_data_interface()` - Connects to `DataInterface` signals.
- `update_video_data()` - Called when the `video_stream_update` signal is emmitted. Displays the new frame on the UI for the *i*th camera. 

# Copilot Window

**This window should display:**

- Sensor data from the ROV via the `DataInterface`
- ROV settings
- **Stdout** from the ROV and UI
- Actions
- Alerts
- Main `VideoStream`
- Task Checklist
- Timer

**Signal Connections:**

- `DataInterface` `rov_data_update` -> `update_rov_data`
- `DataInterface` `float_data_update` -> `update_float_data`
- `DataInterface` `video_stream_update` -> `update_video`
- `DataInterface` `stdout_update` -> `update_stdout`

**Methods:**

- `secs_to_minsec(secs)` - Formats an integer **secs** into a string of form **"mm:ss"**
- `start_timer()` - Starts a `QTimer` object if one has not already been started.
- `stop_timer()` - Stops the `QTimer`. The *stop* widget will become *reset*. If this function is called when the timer is already stopped, it will reset the timer and set all `Task`s to incomplete.
- `timer_timeout()` - Called every second. Updates the timer widgets through `update_time`.
- `update_time()` - Updates the progress bar and remaining text label.
- `build_task_widgets()` - Used in `__init__` to add all `Task` widgets to the `TaskList` container. The `TaskList` is also resized to fit the number of task widgets added. A scrollbar will appear if these overflow.
- `reinitalise_cameras()` - Called when the associated `Action` button is pressed. Each `VideoStream` is re-initialised with `start_init_camera_feed()`
- `check_camera_initialisation_complete()` - Connected to `App`'s `camera_initialisation_complete` signal which is emitted from a `VideoStream` when it successfully initialises. This checks if all `VideoStreams` are finishing trying to initialise so the `Action` button can be unchecked.
- `set_sonar_value(widget, value, value_max` - Set sonar widgets's text to "<vale> cm". If the value exceeds *value_max* then "<value_max> cm" is displayed instead.
- `update_stdout(source, line)` - Writes a new line to the `stdout_window` and preappends the stdout source of this line.
- `update_rov_data()` - If the ROV is connected, it will display the latest values stored in `DataInterface`. Otherwise, all ROV attributes will display "ROV Disconnected".
- `update_float_data()` - If the Float is connected, it will display the latest values stored in `DataInterface`. Otherwise, all Float attributes will display "Float Disconnected."
- `update_video()` - Called when the `video_stream_update` signal is emmitted. Displays the new frame on the UI for the main camera. Any other camera event is ignored.

### ActionThread

This class inherits from Thread.

Actions are functions that the user can perform in the UI when a `QRadioButton` is pressed.
These may take some time to complete and so they run **asynchronously** to the main thead to prevent freezing.

A new action can assigned using the `ActionThread` class.

E.g.
![](README-IMAGES/actionthread.png)

`ActionThread` takes two required arguments and one optional argument:

- action - The `QRadioButton` to bind to.
- target - The main function which should run when the `action` is clicked.
- retain_state(optional. defaults to **False**) - If set to **True**, the action is togglable.
